# Live-server.nvim

A modern, feature-rich live server plugin for Neovim with UI enhancements, state management, and automatic browser opening.
##  ‚ú® Features

* Toggle Servers: Start and stop live-server and browser-sync with a single command.

* State Management: Reliably tracks running servers to prevent duplicates and ensure clean shutdowns.

* UI Lister & Prompts: Use :LiveServerList to view active servers in a floating window, or :LiveServerPrompt to enter a port manually.

* Auto-Open Browser: Automatically opens your default browser to the correct page when a server starts (this can be disabled).

* Smart Directory Detection: Intelligently runs in your project root (if a .git folder exists) or defaults to the current file's directory.

* Automatic Cleanup: Kills all running server instances automatically when you exit Neovim.

* Statusline Integration: Provides a simple component for lualine and other statusline plugins.

##  üì¶ Installation (Lazy.nvim)
```lua
{
  'G00380316/live-server.nvim',
  lazy = false, -- Recommended to ensure VimLeave cleanup always runs
  config = function()
    require("live_server").setup({
      -- your custom options here
    })
  end,
}
```
##  üöÄ Usage

* :LiveServerToggle [port] ‚Äì Toggles the live-server on or off.

* :BrowserSyncToggle [port] ‚Äì Toggles the browser-sync server on or off.

* :LiveServerList ‚Äì Opens a floating window showing all running server instances.

* :LiveServerPrompt ‚Äì Opens a UI prompt to enter a port before starting live-server.

* :LiveServerOpen ‚Äì Opens the URL for the running live-server in your browser.

##  Configuration

You can pass a configuration table to the setup() function. The following are the default values:
``` lua
require("live_server").setup({
  browser_sync_port = 3000,
  live_server_port = 8080,
  files_to_watch = '"*.html, *.css, *.js"',
  auto_open_browser = true, -- Set to false to disable
})
```

##  ‚å®Ô∏è Keymaps

For the best experience, it is highly recommended to set keymaps for the most common commands. You can add these directly to your lazy.nvim plugin spec.

-- In your lazy.nvim spec:
```lua
keys = {
  {
    "<leader>sl",
    function() require("live_server.core").toggle_live_server() end,
    desc = "Toggle Live Server"
  },
  {
    "<leader>sb",
    function() require("live_server.core").toggle_browser_sync() end,
    desc = "Toggle BrowserSync"
  },
  {
    "<leader>sL",
    function() require("live_server.ui").list_servers() end,
    desc = "List Live Servers"
  },
}
```

##  üìå Notes

* This plugin requires live-server and browser-sync to be installed globally via npm. You can install them by running: npm install -g live-server browser-sync.

* The plugin also requires pgrep and pkill to be available on your system for some fallback cleanup operations. These are standard on macOS and most Linux distributions.
